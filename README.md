# Learn-Assembly-with-IBM-Z-OS

# Introduction
 In the month i began using the Learning System from IBM called "Master the Mainframe", which consists of a series of "Challenges" and tasks to work with the Operating System from Mainframes.
 Through the challenges i got to know Assembly, a very interesting programming language. So for anyone who also wants to learn Assembly, i will share how you can skip the tasks in the Learning System (with screenshots) to get to the Assembly part, along with useful links for beginners in Assembly. Have fun!
